# README and READ_ Files

Apply when creating or editing README or READ_ markdown files.

## Scope

- **Audience**: Graduate students (systems engineering); some Python/R; new to Git, AI, APIs.
- **Role**: READMEs are **navigation guides**—concise, not long instructions. Point to activities and files; keep descriptions brief.

## Must Have

1. **Structure** (from `docs/prep/README_template.md`)
   - Header: banner image, **title** (see Custom styling below), short blockquote.
   - Table of Contents with relative anchor links, ordered to show completion sequence.
   - **Activities**: Numbered list with human-readable link text and prefix:
     - `[ACTIVITY: Title](ACTIVITY_name.md)`, `[READ: Title](READ_name.md)`, `[LAB: Title](LAB_name.md)`.
     - Indented sub-items for related scripts (e.g. ``[`file.py`](file.py)``).
   - **Readings**: READ_ links not in the sequence, or `- None.`
   - Footer: footer image, `← 🏠 [Back to Top](#Table-of-Contents)`.

2. **Links**
   - All file mentions use relative hyperlinks.
   - ACTIVITY/READ/LAB: human-readable title + prefix; filename as URL.
   - Code/scripts: ``[`filename.ext`](path)``.

3. **Style**
   - Use **bold**, *italics*, and icons (see Custom styling and `docs/prep/icons.md`).
   - Concise, direct tone. No "obviously", "clearly", "it is critical".
   - Inline code for file names, commands, functions.

## Custom styling

- **Title**: The main heading must be **bold** and <u>underline</u>. Example: **<u>README '/folder/filename'</u>** (use a single `#` for the heading level, then wrap the title text in `**<u>...</u>**`).
- **Subtitles**: All subsection headings (`##`) must be underlined. Format: `## <u>Subtitle text</u>` or `## **<u>Subtitle text</u>**`.
- **Icons**: Use **book emojis** in some places (e.g. 📚 📖 for book-related or reading content). No special color; use icons to add visual interest where they fit.

## Quick Checks

- [ ] Main title is **bold** and <u>underline</u>; all subtitles (`##`) are <u>underline</u>.
- [ ] Book emojis (📚 📖) used in some appropriate places.
- [ ] Activities section is numbered and shows order.
- [ ] Link text uses ACTIVITY:/READ:/LAB: and titles, not raw filenames.
- [ ] No long paragraphs; refer to activity/lab files for detail.
- [ ] Back to Top link in footer.
